This is a Lord of the Rings (LotR) quiz written and implemented entirely by OpenAI's ChatGPT. 

Note that there may be some inaccuracies in the question/answers - for instance, there's no indication that
Elrond was the "captain" of The White Council, but he was indeed a member.

The full chat log with OpenGPT can be found in the docs [here](https://aadnk.github.io/LotrQuizChatGPT/docs/QuizChatSession.htm).

You can try the quiz [directly on Github Pages](https://aadnk.github.io/LotrQuizChatGPT).
